## ðŸ§ª Added Gameplay Features

As part of the assignment, the following gameplay enhancements were added to the "John Lemon" project:

---

### ðŸ§® 1. Dot Product â€“ Enemy Vision Detection
- Implemented custom enemy field-of-view detection using the **dot product**.
- Enemies compare their forward direction to the direction of the player.
- If the player is within range and angle, they are considered "seen".

---

### ðŸ§Š 2. Linear Interpolation â€“ Haunted Chair Movement
- A haunted chair floats eerily between two points using **`Vector3.Lerp`**.
- Rotation speed also uses **linear interpolation** to vary over time, making the chair spin unpredictably.
- Enhances the atmosphere and unpredictability of the environment.

---

### ðŸŽ‡ 3. Particle Effect â€“ Enemy Alert Indicator
- A **3D question mark** particle (from an imported asset) appears above the enemy when they detect the player.
- It is instantiated at runtime and always faces the camera.
- Serves as a visual indicator of enemy awareness.

---

### ðŸ”Š 4. Sound Effect â€“ Alert SFX
- A custom **"huh.wav"** sound effect plays when the enemy first detects the player.
- It only plays once per detection, using `AudioSource` playback logic.

---

### ðŸª‘ 5. Haunted Chair Interaction â€“ Player Shove
- When the haunted chair touches the player, it **physically shoves them** using `AddForce`.
- This can push the player into enemies or hazards, adding tension.
- Two chairs exist in the level: one at the beginning, and one near the end.

---

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation
- All features were tested in Play Mode.
- Both haunted chairs push the player correctly.
- Sound and particle effects only trigger when the player is seen by an enemy.
